This folder contains examples of the dataset files. The datasets are generated in a simulation of the IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The dataset simulates half-hourly data of a full year. 

The data noise are simulated as follows:
(1) The PMU data has TVE=1%.
(2) The noisy smart meter data has 0.1% noise level.
